This is a placeholder file required because npm will only create 
a symlink to a `package.json#bin` entry if the file exists.

This file is replaced in a postinstall step with the actual binary 
downloaded from GitHub releases.

This file has an .exe extension for Windows compatibility because 
Windows requires a file extension to know a file is executable. 

Linux and MacOS will be able to run the file as a normal binary 
regardless of the extension being present.
