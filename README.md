## Installation

You can install Mach from npm or directly as a [binary](.docs/install.md)

```bash
npm install @alshdavid/mach
npx mach --version
```

## Usage

[Read more here](.docs/usage.md)

#### Simple Build

```bash
$ mach build ./src/index.html
> Build Success

$ ls ./dist
> index.html index.js index.css
```

#### Dev Server

```bash
$ mach dev ./src/index.html
> Serving on http://localhost:4242
```

## Benchmark

The benchmark takes the three-js source code, copies it 50 times, imports the 50 copies from a single entrypoint and measures the time to build.

```javascript
import * as copy_1 from './copy_1/Three.js'; window.copy_1 = copy_1;
import * as copy_2 from './copy_2/Three.js'; window.copy_2 = copy_2;
import * as copy_3 from './copy_3/Three.js'; window.copy_3 = copy_3;
// ... and so on
```

The hardware I am using is a desktop AMD 7950x with 16 cores and the builds are using 16 threads.

  <i>Build Time (lower is better)</i>
</p>

As of the 6th March 2023, this is a benchmark of Mach verses other bundlers. Mach is still in the early phase of development so I haven't spent a lot of time optimizing it.

I suspect esbuild is reusing the transformations of files if they have matching hashes so future iterations of this benchmark will add some randomly generated code to each file, ensuring they are all unique.

Mach is spending 80% of its time in the packaging phase (where it converts `import` statements into runtime code). There is a lot of room for optimization here so the numbers are likely to improve as we go üôÇ
