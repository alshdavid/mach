## Installation

You can install Mach from npm or directly as a [binary](.docs/install.md)

```bash
npm install @alshdavid/mach
npx mach --version
```

## Usage

[Read more here](.docs/usage.md)

```bash
$ mach build ./src/index.html
$ mach dev ./src/index.html
```

## Supported Types

Mach has built-in support for the most common source files.

- [TypeScript](mach/src/platform/plugins/transformer_javascript/transformer.rs)
- [JavaScript](mach/src/platform/plugins/transformer_javascript/transformer.rs)
- [JSX and TSX](mach/src/platform/plugins/transformer_javascript/transformer.rs)
- [CSS](mach/src/platform/plugins/transformer_css/transformer.rs)
- [HTML](mach/src/platform/plugins/transformer_html/transformer.rs)
- Images

## Custom Plugins

Mach supports user-added plugins written in TypeScript, JavaScript, Rust and WASM.

### TypeScript & JavaScript Plugins

_Currently in development_

TypeScript and JavaScript plugins are executed within an embedded Deno runtime that is [compatible with the Node.js standard library](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/node/compatibility).

No transpilation is required for TypeScript files or for ES Module formatted plugins. 

Mach uses the existing Parcel plugin APIs:

- [Resolver](https://parceljs.org/features/plugins/#resolvers) (in progress)
- [Transformer](https://parceljs.org/features/plugins/#transformers) (todo)
- [Reporter](https://parceljs.org/features/plugins/#reporters) (todo)
- [Namer](https://parceljs.org/features/plugins/#namers) (todo)

### Rust Plugins

_Preliminary Support, lacking a resolution mechanism - will probably devise a manifest file format in conjunction with distribution via npm_

Dynamically loaded Rust plugins are supported using the [abi_stable](https://crates.io/crates/abi_stable) crate and are loaded by their platform respective `.so`, `.dylib`, `.dll` files.

The plugin API is largely a port of Parcel's to Rust

- [Resolver](mach/src/public/resolver.rs)
- [Transformer](mach/src/public/transformer.rs)

_This isn't yet published to crates.io, but first-class Rust plugin support is coming._

### WASM Plugins

To extend support to other languages, like Go, Python, Dart, etc - plugin developers can build their Plugin to WASM binaries.

This is something I want to do but is low priority.

## Benchmarks

The benchmark takes the three-js source code, copies it 50 times, imports the 50 copies from a single entrypoint and measures the time to build.

```javascript
import * as copy_1 from './copy_1/Three.js'; window.copy_1 = copy_1;
import * as copy_2 from './copy_2/Three.js'; window.copy_2 = copy_2;
import * as copy_3 from './copy_3/Three.js'; window.copy_3 = copy_3;
// ... and so on
```

The hardware I am using is a desktop AMD 7950x with 16 cores and the builds are using 16 threads.

## Blog

**29th March 2024**

As of the 29th March 2024, this is a benchmark of Mach verses other bundlers in a "no minify" build. 

There are still a lot of optimizations left here so the numbers are likely to get better as we go üôÇ

**Plugins**

The next big push will be completing the Deno integration and completing support for Parcel's JS plugin API.

There is already support for dynamically loaded Rust plugins (incomplete but it's there) but JS plugins are all the rage these days so supporting them is vital.

The cool thing about using Deno is that it supports the Node.js standard library, comes with TypeScript support out of the box and can be embedded. This means plugins can be written in TypeScript, target either the Node.js or Deno runtimes and have minimal overhead when calling into.

Of course, JS plugins will be slower than Rust plugins - but embedding Deno into Mach minimizes the overhead associated with the "bridge" between JS land and Rust land, also allowing me to leverage v8 APIs to share the memory and avoid costly copying.

I intend to support:

- [Resolvers](https://parceljs.org/features/plugins/#resolvers)
- [Transformers](https://parceljs.org/features/plugins/#transformers)
- [Reporters](https://parceljs.org/features/plugins/#reporters)
- [Namers](https://parceljs.org/features/plugins/#namers)

The remaining plugins are cool but I don't want to make them modular without a compelling case, especially at the expense of other features.


## Remaining work

The goal of Mach 1 will be a super fast production ready bundler with plugin support with some features remaining to be added (for instance - incremental bundling, or caching). 

The order of these may change and some may be pushed back to Mach 2

**Alpha 1 - Codenamed [Flyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_Flyer)**
- Plugin support
- Minification

**Alpha 2 - Codenamed [Fokker Dr.I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fokker_Dr.I)**
- Source Maps

**Alpha 3 - Codenamed [Spitfire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermarine_Spitfire)**
- Watch mode / Auto-recompilation 
- Development server
- Hot reload

**Alpha 4 - Codenamed [Mustang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_P-51_Mustang)**
- Bundle splitting (help wanted üö©)

**Alpha 5 - Codenamed [Shooting Star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_P-80_Shooting_Star)**
- Incremental Bundling for Development

**Release Candidate - Codenamed [X-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_X-1)**
- TBD

**Mach 1 - Codenamed [Concorde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concorde)**
- TBD
